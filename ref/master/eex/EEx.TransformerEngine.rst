Overview
--------

An abstract engine that is meant to be used and built upon in other
modules. This engine implements the ```EEx.Engine`` <EEx.Engine.html>`__
behaviour and provides a ``transform`` overridable directive that allows
a developer to customize the expression returned by the engine.

Check ```EEx.AssignsEngine`` <EEx.AssignsEngine.html>`__ and
```EEx.SmartEngine`` <EEx.SmartEngine.html>`__ for examples of using
this module.
